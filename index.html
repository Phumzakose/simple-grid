              The first stone was laid on 2 January 1666 and it was completed by
              April 1679. The materials used to build the Castle were local and
              included rock cut from the granite outcrop on Signal Hill, and
              blue slate and shells – transported from Robben Island. The Castle
              was built by soldiers, volunteers, slaves and Khoi undergoing
              punishment. The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South
              African Army in the Western Cape. The yellow paint on the walls
              was chosen to reduce the glare from the sunlight and also because
              it reflects the heat.

              It consists of four hundred members who are elected every five
              years using a party-list proportional representation system.
              Parliament consists of two Houses called the National Assembly and
              National Council of Provinces. Each House has its own distinct
              role and functions, as set out in the Constitution. Members of
              Parliament have freedom of speech, subject only to the rules of
              the Houses, when they participate in committees or debates. They
              have that right to ensure that they, as elected public
              representatives, can bring important matters to the attention of
              the Houses and the public.

              The Hall itself is made up of components from all over the world.
              The honey-coloured stone, which makes up its façade of limestone,
              was imported from Bath in England. The tower houses a clock and a
              number of bells, modelled on the famous Big Ben. The clock strikes
              the hours and chimes the Westminster quarters, which is a
              particular chime originating from St Mary’s Cathedral in England.
              Originally consisting of thirty-seven bells it was first rung on
              the 30th April 1925 when the Prince of Wales visited this country.
